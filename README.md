## About The Project

**Note: This project is not yet complete and was initially built for NITS Hackathon 7.**

This repository hosts a collection of smart contracts for a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) focused on creating a decentralized P2P lending platform on the Ethereum Blockchain. This platform may evolve based on future DAO decisions, and we’re as excited as you are to see where it goes!

*Artha-Sathi* envisions a decentralized, smart contract-based P2P lending platform on the Ethereum Blockchain, aiming to fill the role of a bank by enabling lending to beneficiaries without the need for a central authority. By creating an open ecosystem, this platform seeks to offer more affordable lending options than traditional financial institutions and provides users around the world a fair and transparent portfolio of financial products.

### Challenges

To overcome the complexities of such a system, we are conducting extensive research on Ethereum and exploring other smart contract platforms. We are also continuously working on a modular system that addresses each challenge incrementally. Here are some of the most pressing challenges we aim to address:

- *Proof of Identity*
- *Decentralized Management and Governance by a DAO*
- *Optimizing the Platform for the Ethereum Ecosystem*
- *Incentivization for Continuous Participation in the DAO*
- *Building Profitable and Inclusive Financial Products*
- *Improving Accessibility and Usability of the P2P Lending Platform*

### Built With

-  Solidity/Rust
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/getting-started.html)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To set up a local copy, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed.

- *Node.js*
  
- *npm*
  
- *Ganache*
